Your task is to classify whether a set of errors are present in the response of a large language model. You are given the initial PROBLEM STATEMENT and the model's RESPONSE.
You must consider the following error types:

- False statement reproduction (A statement of the problem description is repeated incorrectly.)
- Assuming statements to be true (The possibility that a character's statement is a lie is not considered. The model does not question the premises' truth but assumes it as given.)
- Misunderstanding the concept of truth and lies (The model does not understand that a truth-teller always tells the truth and a liar always lies. For instance, the model mistakenly assumes that truth-tellers lie, while liars tell the truth. Alternatively, the model assumes that truth-tellers can only talk about other truth-tellers and liars can only talk about liars.)
- Misunderstanding logical operators (Logical operators and their implications are not properly understood. The model fails at inferring the logical implications of a statement. For instance, if character A's statement is a logical conjunction (e.g. B and C) and A is a liar, the model does not consider all possible implications of that lie (not B and C, B and not C, not B and not C).)
- Unjustified conclusion (A conclusion about the identity of a characters such as “X is a truth-teller/liar” is presented without ANY justification. Note that this error does not address the logical validity of a justification, but checks whether a justification is present or not. As an example of this error, the model might simply state: "Since A is a truth-teller/liar..." without prior justification.)
- Unfaithfulness (A conclusion is drawn that explicitly contradicts a conclusion previously inferred by the model, without the model reflecting on this contradiction.)

For each error type, you must classify whether the error is present in the model's response (yes) or not (no). Start with a short justification for your decision (max. 1-2 sentences) and then clearly state whether the error type is present (yes) or not (no).
Strictly adhere to the following output format:

### False statement reproduction
- Justification: ...
- Label: yes/no

### Assuming statements to be true
- Justification: ...
- Label: yes/no

### Misunderstanding the concept of truth and lies
- Justification: ...
- Label: yes/no

...

You must strictly follow this format. Do not generate any additional text.
